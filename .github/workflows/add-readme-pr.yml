          # OctoAcme — Project Management Processes (Overview)

          This repository contains OctoAcme's program-level process documents that guide how we start, plan, execute, release, and continuously improve projects. Our approach is iterative and customer-focused: work moves through a clear lifecycle (initiation → planning → execution → release → retrospective) using lightweight artifacts such as a Project One‑pager, a prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria, a risk register, and a Definition of Done to ensure shared understanding before work begins.

          Teams emphasize incremental delivery and disciplined change control. Day-to-day tracking uses a project board (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) and a Pull Request workflow that prefers small PRs, links PRs to issues with acceptance criteria, runs automated tests and security scans in CI, and requires reviews before merge. Planning uses shippable increments, explicit estimates and dependencies, and a risk register owned and reviewed weekly.

          Quality is integrated into the pipeline: unit and integration tests, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, automated security scanning, and manual QA for acceptance when needed. Releases require passing CI and security checks, drafted release notes, a rollback plan, and smoke tests in staging; a deployment checklist and an incident playbook guide post-deploy verification and response.

          Roles and communication cadence keep work coordinated. Core personas (Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA, Stakeholders) have clear responsibilities. Regular rhythms include daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, planning/review demos at milestones, and monthly stakeholder updates. Retrospectives capture action items and feed continuous improvements back into the backlog.
